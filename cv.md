Formerly a Civil Engineer, specialising in bridges. My time in my previous profession was spent transforming complex ideas from drawings on paper into physical structures. I’m proud of the projects I’ve worked on and the infrastructure I have built. Looking ahead, I’m now excited to leave my mark on the digital landscape, to build in a new world where there seems to be no limit to what can be created. This is a great time to be an Engineer.

Having recently graduated from Makers Academy, Europe’s leading coding bootcamp, I’m now seeking a new opportunity as a Junior Developer, to apply the skills I developed building structures of concrete and steel, to building programs of objects and messages. 

##Skills
####Teamwork
I am a dynamic team member who enjoys contributing to a work environment which is built on trust and support, assisting others when needed and asking for help when necessary. From working on challenging engineering projects, mentoring junior engineers, through to pair programming at Makers Academy, I understand that collaboration, influence and compromise are vital for effective teamwork, and effective teamwork is a requirement for success. 

####Reasoning & Decision Making
Concrete. To most people it’s grey and boring. In reality it’s an immensely complex and highly strung material, which in practice doesn’t always conform to theory, or respect your project timeline. The dynamic nature of Civil Engineering required me to evaluate unforeseeable problems as they arose and exercise informed judgement in high pressure situations. Often, there was no 'right' solution, and deciding on the best way forward was not immediately obvious. By considering the facts of the situation, the options available, and the consequences of any decision, coupled with a willingness to take measured risks, I was able to move the project forward knowing the strengths and compromises of what I was building.

####Communication
My previous roles have required me to communicate to a variety of project stakeholders. From government agencies and private clients through to subcontractors and construction operatives. One thing that has been consistent regardless of the audience, has been the importance of timeliness in making that communication effective.

####Planning & Time Management
Robust planning has been critical on all of the projects I have worked on. Timescales varied from several years over the life cycle of the project, down to 15min intervals for a bridge replacement during a railway shutdown. Following these plans required strict time management. When given 60hrs access to a railway over a Christmas shutdown, all focus was on completing the works and handing the track back in operational condition within that timeframe. Any delay would have resulted in huge disruption to train timetables, equally huge fines from train operators, and a possible mention in the news the following morning. Projects such as these have mastered my planning and time management skills to ensure objectives are met on time and to the required standard.
